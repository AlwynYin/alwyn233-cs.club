# Nice Mac Applications

This is a list of good tools that I find handy, most of them are free (in terms of license) and/or open source.

## Basic Applications

>These apps provide basic functionalities that **Apple should have implemented themselves**

|App | Description | |
|---|---|---|
|[**Mos**](https://github.com/Caldis/Mos)|Reverses your mouse scroll, so that you can use scroll wheel as usual without changing track pad scroll direction. It also provides a smooth scrolling function but fails to work in a lot of applications.|
|[**Rectangle**](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle)|Resize windows when snapped to edge of a screen, also supports customized shortcuts
[**Better Display**](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay)|Use retina on not-to-scale screens e.g. 1080p

## Good-to-haves

|[**Amethyst**](https://ianyh.com/amethyst/)|Tiling window manager|doesn't need to disable SIP, but less feature-rich
|[**Alt-Tab**](https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos)|Windows like alt-tab window switching, provides thumbnail per window, instead of per-app switching
